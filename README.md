# Js-simplified-abridged-homepage
This is a tiny bit from a project i'm currently working on: a free introductory course I named "JS simplified". 
Building the website to assist anyone totally new to native javascript or struggling with applying js concepts/basics. 
I also learn more when I teach what i know. Call to action svg icons gotten from www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons page.
